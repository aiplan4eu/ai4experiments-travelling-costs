# ai4experiments-travelling-costs
This repository contains the code that integrates the up-graphene-engine and the travelling-costs problem (navigating a graph with costs associated to each edge) to create a component in the ai4experiments platform.

The aiplan4eu-travelling component and the aiplan4eu-t-cos solution are generated from this repo.
