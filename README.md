# ai4experiments-travelling-costs
This repository contains the code that integrates the up-graphene-engine and the travelling-costs problem (navigating a graph with costs associated to each edge) to create a component in the ai4experiments platform.

The aiplan4eu-travelling-costs component and the aiplan4eu-trvCst solution are generated from this repo.
